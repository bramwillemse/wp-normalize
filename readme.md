# WP Normalize

The idea of this plugin is to be a kind of CSS reset / normalize for WordPress.
It strips some parts I never use or don't want my users to see/use and adds some things, like my phone number on the bottom of every dashboard page and extends user rights for the editor role.

## Todo

- Code review
- Split into modules/classes
- Add feature list to readme

## Roadmap
- v1.0.6: Code review based tweaks
- v1.1: Minimalize
